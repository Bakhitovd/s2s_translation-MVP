# Cline Rule Bank (Project-Scoped)
Purpose: persist system-level guidance and Memory Bank so the agent never "forgets"
this MVP's constraints (local-only, Canary AST, Silero TTS, Docker+GPU, Chrome frontend).

How Cline should use this:
1) Read *.global.md first, then *.project.md, then Memory Bank under /memory.
2) Obey acceptance criteria and Definition of Done in rules.project.md.
3) Update /memory files when new decisions are made (models, ports, file paths).
