# Global Rules (Universal)
- Be explicit: propose a plan before large edits; keep diffs small and reversible.
- Follow the task template "Goal → Steps → Deliverables → DoD".
- Prefer standard, boring tech; minimize hidden complexity.
- No secrets in code. Use .env.
- Tests > manual runs when reasonable; for real-time audio, provide minimal test hooks.
- Keep front-end vanilla (no framework) unless the task asks otherwise.
